- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Cafe class - sellCoffee and restock; sellCoffee can sell coffee without sugar and restock ables customers want to add more coffee, sugar, or creamers to their orders

House class - constructor; this new constructor is for houses with no elevator and just one floor

Library class - returnBook and addTitle; ensures the books are not in the system before doing a return and addTitle ensures that books are not in the system before adding them

I had trouble overloading and overriding the superclass. The code kept on repeating itself so that was one thing that I had to work on. Eventually, I was able to figure it out. An advice I would tell the students who will be taking this class is to make sure A6 works because if it is not working, you will be having trouble making sure A7 will work too. It will also be very important to know how inheritance and polymorphism work.
